#useful
these are just some useful shell commands I keep forgetting and have to keep googling, I like to write them down every so often when I come across them
#grepSearchFilesInDirectories
find "xyz" in all files in subdirectories of working folder
#lscolor
macos and remote ssh sessions often don't use color output on the ls so use this to get color results when running ls
#vsCodeCollapseSection
i keep forgetting the shortcut for collapsing curly braces in vscode -- link in file is how to do that
#updateAllRepos
updates all git repos in working directory + subdirectories -- useful for large codebases with interdependant repositories

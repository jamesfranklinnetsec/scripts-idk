# convert-PNG-and-png-to-jpg.sh
I had a program that did not play nicely with image files saved as capital PNG or capital JPG etc, so i made this program to convert them into lower case so that could be used.

The lower caseified  files are then compressed into jpeg using the parameters on line 8

## WARNING
This is a one way process. I don't provide a way to reverse it, although that would be trivial to do, just read through the code

## Usage
run script in folder containing the images and it will convert them.
